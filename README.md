# Week-1-Homework
For this weeks homework assignment, I edited a company website. I properly organized the html and css code, added notes, fixed a broken link, and generally organized the code to be more easily readable.

## Screenshot:
i added a screenshot in the images file. when i checked git status, it claimed 
everything was up to date and on the main branch. unfortunately, when i checked 
the github repository it was not present. i tried to resolve it through my own 
research but was not able to do so in a timely manner.
i am sorry to you and i am sorry to myself for not resolving this earlier.
